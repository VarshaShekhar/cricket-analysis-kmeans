## 📄 Description

This repository contains a **K-Means clustering analysis** performed on cricket players' performance data.  
We focus on two key features:

- **Average Runs** 🏏  
- **Bowling Economy** 🎯  

The goal is to **cluster players based on their dominant skill set** (batting or bowling) and visualize performance patterns.

## 🧩 Notebook Contents

- **🔹 Data Loading & Normalization:** Preprocessing player statistics.  
- **🔹 K-Means Implementation:** Custom function to run K-Means from scratch.  
- **🔹 Clustering & Visualization:** Plots for K = 2, 3, 4, 5.  
- **🔹 Interpretation & Observations:** Insights from clusters and recommendations for K selection.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **K = 2:** Clear separation into **batting-oriented** and **bowling-oriented** players — most intuitive.  
- **K = 3:** Splits batting players into two clusters for **moderate granularity**.  
- **K = 4–5:** Over-segmentation; clusters start overlapping and become harder to interpret.

**✅ Conclusion:**  
Both K = 2 and K = 3 provide meaningful insights. K = 2 is ideal for simplicity and clarity, while K = 3 offers more granularity among batting players.
